# Introduction

The aim of this course is to develop core technical skills in coding, digital literacy,  computational thinking, and use of git and other tools, that are used in software development and in the games industry. The course uses Godot Game Engine and github, however I will also show examples using Unity, Python and other relevant tehcnologies. Over the course of the module, students will build a portfolio of work on their github repositories and will have the opportunity to do projects in many creative areas such as art, music and games development. Skills acquired on the module are transferrable to other engines and technologies and provide solid foundation for a future career in game development.

# Structure

Semester 1

Monday:

- 12:00-13:00 - Studio Classroom
- 13:00-14:00 - Time for lunch and engagement with campus activities
- 14:00-17:00 - Studio Classroom

Semester 2

Thursday:

- 12:00-13:00 - Studio Classroom
- 13:00-14:00 - Time for lunch and engagement with campus activities
- 14:00-17:00 - Studio Classroom

*Studio Classroom* means: we work together in a lab class on various topics and projects, building competency through experience, in various areas of software and games development. We will take plenty of breaks to get up and walk around.

At the end of the module, each student will have the ability to develop a complete digital game from scratch incorporating logic, movement and gameplay and manage their work on github.

# Assessment

- End of year programming test 30%
- Weekly engagement mark 20%
- [Assignment 1 25% - Due 9/12/2024](assignments.md)
- [Assignment 2 25% - Due 10/4/2024](assignments.md)

Weekly engagement mark is assessessed automatically by evaluating the number of git commits made each week. 1 commit means 1 mark. 2 commits 2 marks, 3 commits or more full marks each week.
