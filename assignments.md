"A Musical Toy" 

![](images/cybertrad.png.jpg)

For this individual assignment you will be exploring musical play and experimentation, by creating a virtual musical instrument using Godot. 

This will be a screen where you press buttons, move sliders and it makes different sounds etc. It could be a toy that you give to baby brother or sister to entertain them on an ipad that makes animal sounds with pictures, or it could have more complexity and expressiveness. 

Your project should demonstrate:

- At least one scene with a nice looking user interface design
- Some interactivity with buttons connected up to some code that make sounds
- An array
- A loop
- An if statement
- Doing some basic stuff with Godot
- Making git commits

## Rubric

| Category | Weighting | 1 | 2.1 | 2.2 | Pass | Fail |
|----------|-----------|--------|----|----|----|----|
| Complexity | 33% | For loops and arrays. Use of different systems in Godot. A lot of new nodes created. Complex UI interaction such as drag and drop, timers, UI controls. UI created procedurally. Lots of variety in the sounds created. Use of controllers or external input. The instrument is "programmable". Sound is generated procedurally. Excellent visual feedback | Simple UI based on clicking buttons to make sounds. Use of loops and at least one array. Use of timers. UI is generated in editor.  No external input. Good variety of sounds. Based on a real instrument | A basic soundboard with buttons to make sounds | Forked the repo, made some commits, not much working, but it makes a sound | Failed to fork the repo, no commits made |
| Aesthetic | 33% | Novel user interface for creating live sound. Complex button and knob arrangement. High quality of visual design. Original, high quality assets produced. Original  recorded audio. Visually coherent and easy to use. Great variety of musical expressiveness. Sounds are interesting and coherent. Crazy and beautiful and lots of novelty | Straightforward, intuitive interface with a reasonable amount of control of a good range of sound. Ability to perform live with a good degree of expression. Some simple assets created. | Basic interface with one screen. Some assets made and some acquired from online sources. Not too much variety in the expressiveness of the instrument | Simple or unintuitive user interface. User interface made from premade assets. Sound are premade or made using simple tools | Basic user interface that makes sound, without any expressiveness or novelty or much fun. | Project doesnt make any sound
| Documentation | 33% | Large number of commits. Good quality video demo and good documentation, with all sections completed. Commits evenly spaced throughout the project | Smaller number of commits over a shorter period of time, but a good bit of work evident in the latter weeks of the project. Video and documentation completed to high standard | All done in week or two before the delivery date. Lots of commits in last two weeks. Documentation incomplete or video incomplete. | All done in the final week. Incomplete documentation or video. Few commits | No use of git. project doesnt work |
