# Assignment 2: Chromatic Artillery: A Shooter as Art

For this individual assignment, you will subvert the traditional shooter game genre by creating an artistic 2D or 3D "spreading joy" game using Godot. Instead of shooting to destroy, your player character will spread positive elements like love, colors, music, or life throughout the game world. The game can be top-down, side-scrolling, or any other perspective you choose. Transform the typical "enemy" into beings that need happiness, color, or healing. Your game should include at least one level, a start screen, player character, scoring system based on positive actions, and interactive non-player characters.
Project Requirements

Create positive particle effects (hearts, flowers, colors, musical notes)
Transform "hostile" environments into vibrant, living spaces
Score points through acts of creation rather than destruction
Use sound and music to enhance the peaceful atmosphere
Design characters that evolve visually as they receive positive energy

This reframing maintains all the technical learning objectives while promoting creative, non-violent gameplay. Students can explore themes like:

Environmental restoration
Spreading art through a gray world
Converting sadness into joy
Musical harmony bringing people together
Growing gardens in unexpected places

Would you like me to elaborate on any aspect of this reframing?

## Project Requirements

Your project should demonstrate:

- At least one scene with a well-designed user interface
- Interactivity with player controls and npc behavior
- arrays, loops, and if statements
- Implementation of scoring and level progression
- Use of Godot systems (e.g., physics, animation, sound, particle systems)
- Regular Git commits with meaningful messages

## Rubric

| Category | Weighting | 1 | 2.1 | 2.2 | Pass | Fail |
|----------|-----------|--------|----|----|----|----|
| Complexity | 33% | Advanced use of loops, arrays, and conditionals. Complex enemy AI, multiple levels, power-ups, and procedural generation. Use of advanced Godot systems like shaders, particle effects, and custom scripts. High interactivity and replayability. | Good use of loops, arrays, and conditionals. Multiple enemy types, scoring system, and at least one level. Use of Godot systems like physics and animation. | Basic shooter mechanics with one level, scoring, and a an enemy. Minimal use of Godot systems. | Forked the repo, made some commits, basic mechanics implemented but incomplete. | Failed to fork the repo, no commits made, or project doesn't run. |
| Aesthetic | 33% | High-quality, original assets (art, sound, animations). Visually cohesive and polished. Excellent visual feedback and effects. Unique and engaging art style. | Good-quality assets, some original and some acquired. Visually appealing and functional. Some visual feedback and effects. | Basic assets, mostly acquired. Functional but lacks polish. Minimal visual feedback. | Simple or unintuitive visuals. Assets are mostly premade. | Basic visuals with no polish or coherence. |
| Documentation | 33% | Extensive and well-organized documentation. High-quality video demo. Regular, meaningful Git commits throughout the project. | Good documentation and video demo. Regular Git commits, mostly meaningful. | Basic documentation and video demo. Git commits concentrated near the end of the project. | Incomplete documentation or video. Few Git commits. | No documentation or video. No Git usage. |

"A Musical Toy" 

![](images/cybertrad.png.jpg)

For this individual assignment you will be exploring musical play and experimentation, by creating a virtual musical instrument using Godot. 

This will be a screen where you press buttons, move sliders and it makes different sounds etc. It could be a toy that you give to baby brother or sister to entertain them on an ipad that makes animal sounds with pictures, or it could have more complexity and expressiveness. 

Your project should demonstrate:

- At least one scene with a nice looking user interface design
- Some interactivity with buttons connected up to some code that make sounds
- An array
- A loop
- An if statement
- Doing some basic stuff with Godot
- Making git commits

## Rubric

| Category | Weighting | 1 | 2.1 | 2.2 | Pass | Fail |
|----------|-----------|--------|----|----|----|----|
| Complexity | 33% | For loops and arrays. Use of different systems in Godot. A lot of new nodes created. Complex UI interaction such as drag and drop, timers, UI controls. UI created procedurally. Lots of variety in the sounds created. Use of controllers or external input. The instrument is "programmable". Sound is generated procedurally. Excellent visual feedback | Simple UI based on clicking buttons to make sounds. Use of loops and at least one array. Use of timers. UI is generated in editor.  No external input. Good variety of sounds. Based on a real instrument | A basic soundboard with buttons to make sounds | Forked the repo, made some commits, not much working, but it makes a sound | Failed to fork the repo, no commits made |
| Aesthetic | 33% | Novel user interface for creating live sound. Complex button and knob arrangement. High quality of visual design. Original, high quality assets produced. Original  recorded audio. Visually coherent and easy to use. Great variety of musical expressiveness. Sounds are interesting and coherent. Crazy and beautiful and lots of novelty | Straightforward, intuitive interface with a reasonable amount of control of a good range of sound. Ability to perform live with a good degree of expression. Some simple assets created. | Basic interface with one screen. Some assets made and some acquired from online sources. Not too much variety in the expressiveness of the instrument | Simple or unintuitive user interface. User interface made from premade assets. Sound are premade or made using simple tools | Basic user interface that makes sound, without any expressiveness or novelty or much fun. | Project doesnt make any sound
| Documentation | 33% | Large number of commits. Good quality video demo and good documentation, with all sections completed. Commits evenly spaced throughout the project | Smaller number of commits over a shorter period of time, but a good bit of work evident in the latter weeks of the project. Video and documentation completed to high standard | All done in week or two before the delivery date. Lots of commits in last two weeks. Documentation incomplete or video incomplete. | All done in the final week. Incomplete documentation or video. Few commits | No use of git. project doesnt work |
