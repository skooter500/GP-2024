### GDScript Loops and Procedural Patterns Worksheet
**Estimated Time:** 2 hours  
**Objective:** Learn how to use loops in GDScript to create procedural patterns using the `draw` function.  
**Prerequisites:** Basic understanding of GDScript, Godot Engine, and familiarity with coordinate systems.

---

### Part 1: Understanding Loops in GDScript (30 minutes)

#### Exercise 1: Basic Loops
1. **For Loop**  
   Write a `for` loop that prints numbers from 1 to 10 in the output console.

2. **While Loop**  
   Write a `while` loop that prints numbers from 10 to 1 in the output console.

3. **Nested Loops**  
   Write a nested loop (a loop inside another loop) that prints a 3x3 grid of coordinates like this:
   ```
   (0, 0) (0, 1) (0, 2)
   (1, 0) (1, 1) (1, 2)
   (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 2)
   ```

### Part 2: Drawing with Loops (1 hour)

#### Exercise 2: Drawing Lines with a Loop
1. **Horizontal Lines**  
   Use the `draw_line` function inside a `for` loop to draw 10 horizontal lines across the screen. Space them evenly.

2. **Vertical Lines**  
   Modify the code to draw 10 vertical lines instead of horizontal lines.

3. **Grid Pattern**  
   Combine horizontal and vertical lines to create a grid pattern. Use nested loops to draw the grid.

### Part 3: Procedural Patterns (30 minutes)

#### Exercise 3: Drawing Circles in a Pattern
1. **Circle Pattern**  
   Use a loop to draw 10 circles in a row. Space them evenly and make their radius increase by 5 pixels each time.

2. **Spiral Pattern**  
   Use a loop to draw a spiral pattern. Hint: Use polar coordinates (angle and radius) to calculate the position of each point.

### Part 4: Challenge (Optional, 30 minutes)

#### Exercise 4: Procedural Art
1. **Custom Pattern**  
   Create your own procedural pattern using loops and the `draw` functions. Experiment with shapes, colors, and spacing. For example:
   - Draw concentric circles.
   - Draw a checkerboard pattern.
   - Draw a star pattern.

### Submission
- Save your scripts and scenes in a Godot project and make commits on your fork of the repo.
- Alternatively zip and upload your submission through brightspace
- Export your project or take screenshots of your patterns.
